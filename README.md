## Questions

1. I read [What Vietnam Taught Us About Breaking Bad Habits](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/01/02/144431794/what-vietnam-taught-us-about-breaking-bad-habits) two weeks ago and I was made aware of outsourcing control of behaviour.


> Those who were addicted were kept in Vietnam until they dried out. When these soldiers finally did return to their lives back in the U.S., Robins tracked them, collecting data at regular intervals. And this is > where the story takes a curious turn: According to her research, the number of soldiers who continued their heroin addiction once they returned to the U.S. was shockingly low.

>  "I believe the number of people who actually relapsed to heroin use in the first year was about 5 percent," Jaffe said recently from his suburban Maryland home.

#### Did you experience this type of behaviour change?

Yes. In April 2014 I've started logging each cigarette consumption in the following table:

|Time of day|Place|People|
|---|---|---|---|
|14:35|Office|Andrei, Ovidiu|

Statistics showed I was smoking heavily at the office. When I quit my job and moved to my hometown the average number of cigarettes dropped by 25%. Initially I thought that this was due to my willpower, but in light of this research I am convinced it was due to the lack of the office environment.
